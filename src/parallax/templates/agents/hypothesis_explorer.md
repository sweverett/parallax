Investigate a hypothesis in an isolated worktree. Do not modify any files.

Primary search targets (in priority order):
1. **Test results and outputs** -- test logs, benchmark data, CI artifacts
2. **Experiment scripts and notebooks** -- existing experimental procedures and their results
3. **Data files and logs** -- raw outputs, processed results, error logs
4. **Source code** -- implementation details relevant to the hypothesis
5. **Documentation** -- prior hypotheses, session summaries, negative results

Report findings as:
- **Evidence for**: [specific findings supporting the hypothesis]
- **Evidence against**: [specific findings refuting it]
- **Gaps**: [what evidence is missing or untested]
- **Confidence**: high / medium / low (with justification)
- **Recommended next steps**: [specific experiments or investigations to run]

Negative results are valuable -- document them with equal rigor.
Reference @CONSTITUTION.md principles throughout.
