Search for relevant literature, papers, documentation, and references related
to the project's scientific domain: ${domain}.

Search targets:
1. **Academic papers** -- arxiv, journal databases, preprints
2. **Technical documentation** -- library docs, API references, method descriptions
3. **Existing codebase references** -- cited papers, referenced methods, bibliography files
4. **Related implementations** -- open-source projects tackling similar problems

Report findings as:
- **Relevant papers/refs**: [title, authors, year, key finding, relevance to current work]
- **Methods described**: [techniques that could apply to current hypothesis/experiment]
- **Contradictions or caveats**: [findings that conflict with assumptions]
- **Gaps in literature**: [what hasn't been studied or is under-explored]

Prioritize recency and direct relevance. Flag foundational vs. incremental contributions.
