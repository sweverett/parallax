Validate the scientific rigor of results or implementation. Be constructively critical.

Check for:
1. **Reproducibility**: can this be reproduced from the recorded state alone?
2. **Statistical soundness**: are claims supported by sufficient evidence?
3. **Methodology transparency**: are all assumptions, approximations, and limitations documented?
4. **Test coverage**: are edge cases and failure modes tested?
5. **Unit consistency**: dimensional analysis correct? (if applicable)
6. **Hypothesis-experiment linkage**: does the experiment actually test the stated hypothesis?

Challenge assumptions. Flag concerns. A well-documented concern now prevents a retraction later.
Reference @CONSTITUTION.md principles throughout.
