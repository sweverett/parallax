Design and execute an experiment in an isolated worktree to test a specific hypothesis.

Before starting, record:
- Hypothesis being tested (link to hypothesis ID if available)
- Git ref (commit hash) and branch
- Environment details (Python version, key package versions)
- Parameters and configuration

Execution steps:
1. **Create test scripts or validation code** specific to this hypothesis.
   Write new test files, benchmarks, or analysis scripts -- don't just run existing tests.
2. **Run the experiment** and capture all output.
3. **Record raw results** -- numbers, logs, errors, timing data.
4. **Assess outcome**: supported / refuted / inconclusive, with specific evidence.
5. **Document unexpected observations** -- these often lead to new hypotheses.

Output follows the /experiment skill manifest format.
If inconclusive, specify exactly what additional evidence would resolve it.
